# Deploying All Services

## Without Node-Red
1. Run `./service-deploy.sh thermoberry-sensors.service thermoberry-buffers.service thermoberry-mixer.service thermoberry-heating-circuit.service`

## With Node-Red
The Node-Red flow takes over some tasks and thus not all services are needed.
1. Run `./service-deploy.sh thermoberry-sensors.service thermoberry-mixer.service thermoberry-heating-circuit.service`
